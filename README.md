# Gotogen

Protogen, the Go way.

Highly volatile during active development. For ease of my own development, there are `replace` directives in `go.mod` to use relative paths for the related modules (`go.work` wasn't working for me). I will attempt to keep all the repositories up to date. You will need to either remove the `replace` directives, or have all the repositories checked out next to each other.
